	Upon reaching the roof, the Cellist lashes out at you in anger,
	thinking you're there only to pity him or give him hollow
	platitudes, before apologizing for losing his temper again.
	&r1a2
	
r1a2:
	He explains the reasons for his substance abuse (primarily self-
	loathing), and dismissively writes himself off as a lost cause 
	only kept around by the other cats out of pity, and just wants them 
	to throw him out already so he can finish self-destructing.
	&r1a3
	
r1a3:
	Upon being pressed, he admits he knows they care, but hates himself
	for disappointing them when he relapses into bad habits while they 
	try to help, and tries to push them away for their own good, as he
	thinks that will make them stop hurting themselves for him.
	&r1a4
	
r1a4:
	You explain that deliberately shutting his friends out only causes 
	them more pain in the long run, as they're willing to accept slip-ups
	and instability to help their friend get better, but shutting them out
	and making them watch him fall apart is far worse in comparison.
	&r1a5
	
r1a5:
	Realizing this makes the Cellist's emotional dam break, and he falls
	apart crying. You sit with him until he calms down, both of you knowing
	his problems are far from resolved, but he now understands what
	his friends are trying to do, and will let them help. *mark_seen*

# Jazztronauts
Videogames are the poison, Jazztronauts is the cure.


### What is this
Jazztronauts is a cooperative theft-em-up for Garry's Mod, also known as prop hunt 2.
Go to random maps on the workshop, pillage its trash for money, and converse with your higher-dimensional cat overlords.

- If you want instructions on installing it the normal way, follow this link for the official FAQ.
- Else, this repo can just be smashed into your addons folder, it is a self-contained jazztronauts installation

### Features
- Dynamically download and mount workshop map addons
- Load in BSP data for specific effects, such as stealing static props and world brushes
- Dynamic dialog/mission system
- Persistent player data, and newgame+ mode
- Hammer I/O viewer gun, watch I/O events happen in real time
- Lots of pretty pretty art

### Contributions
This repository is hooked up to build and upload directly to the [Steam Workshop addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1452613192) "wheneverâ„¢". 
Contributions are always welcome, and can be done through the normal github pull request avenue, and I'll try to update the workshop version as soon as I can after that.

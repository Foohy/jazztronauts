	Do take a seat, and make sure you maintain a neutral facial 
	expression and an even tone. We may be being watched.

	I have a final job for you. A special order. I require.%.%.% antlions. 
	Ten antlions, to be exact. *start 5*
	&a3

a3:
	I have a friend who has promised me a regular supply of their eggs. 
	For some of the more...dubious secret menu offerings.
	&a4

a4:
	This will be the last job I can offer you, as arranging this deal 
	and covering your payment quite effectively drains my personal 
	coffers, but I assure you the payment will be worth the effort.

	Keep your voice down, please. While I just finished removing two 
	bugging devices from beneath barstools, I expect to find at least  
	four more. 
	&a5

a5:
	Who put them there? Oh, that doesn't matter. I will take care of it,
	I assure you. 
	&a6

a6:
	To further reward you when you have finished this job, I have 
	arranged an event for everyone to partake in. 
	&a7

a7:
	Feel free to take your time on this one, I have a lot to do on my 
	end. If you're having trouble finding them, look for arena maps,
	or the Half-Life 2 maps that feature them.

	Delightful. Thank you kindly for your service. In a few years, I'll 
	be able to put scrambled antlion eggs back on the secret menu.

	Don't worry, I did a full sweep of the Bar Samsara and removed all 
	remaining surveillance devices. I traced the signal to its source 
	and sent a gift basket along to the address.

	I don't have much time for subterfuge these days. I do so hope they 
	enjoy the grenades.

	Now! The matter of payment.

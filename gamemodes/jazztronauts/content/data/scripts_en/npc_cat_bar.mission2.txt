     Tell me, *player*, have you ever had a Cosmic Squeeze?
     It's a favorite cocktail of mine.

     Unfortunately, preparing it requires a substantial amount of fresh
     watermelon juice, and at this juncture, fresh produce is in short
     supply around here. Luckily, this dimensional juncture appears to be
     quite fond of the fruit, as there's a downright odd amount here.
     &a2

a2:
     If you could obtain ten or so, I could potentially add the Cosmic
     Squeeze to the menu for the day. I can guarantee you cash for
     your efforts, as well. *start 2*

	Oh! I didn't hear you approach, *player*.

	Just doing a stock check. It'll take me a while, so there's no need

    Excellent, excellent! Oh, I'm almost giddy. I haven't had the chance

    and sets it on the bar. With a flick of her paw, it becomes encased
    in a pulsing, pink sphere. Her face furrows in intense concentration,
    and you hear something uncannily like a Wilhelm scream from within.

    > After a few seconds, she slides a glass full of a glimmering silver
    liquid under the sphere, which dissipates. Two tiny balls of
    watermelon fall into the glass, and you hear a muffled explosion
    as they sink through the silver fluid.

    inside is, now. Hesitantly, you take a sip.

    help, *player*. *finish 2*

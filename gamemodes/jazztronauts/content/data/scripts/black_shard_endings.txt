The trolley hurtles through the void/wall/offscreen and smacks into the eclipse cat with the cow catcher, 
sends them hurtling out of view. Bartender is driving, Singer’s hanging out of the window, Pianist dangles out of the door 
and stares in direction the eclipse cat was flung. If we can give the Pianist A Gun that’d be rad, if not that’s fine. 
Cellist dangles out the other side of the door and has his hand outstretched

Cut to the eclipse cat floating in the void, some kind of messed up vfx of it maybe stretching and distorting like 
when a model gets all fucked up by twisting in ways it shouldn’t. Bartender reverses out of the hole she made and does a
sick u-turn on the narrow strip of voidway track. The void should be all fucked up, maybe with the red shard effect? 
As the trolley starts to go, everything gets shaky and the road starts to crack up.

    and keep your mouth shut because i've got one last request for you.% 
    i'm staking what's left of my liquid cash until we hit up our fence 
    again on this working so you better not fuck this up.

   i need you to go out there and find me milk cartons.%% a lot of milk 
   cartons.%% i don't care if they've been left out and gotten all gross 
   and nasty and starting to like congeal and shit,% in fact that's ideal.

   i can't go to The Bartender for this because that would require 
   explaining what i want to do with it and i do not have the capacity 
   to lie to her convincingly at this juncture so just do me a solid here 
   okay

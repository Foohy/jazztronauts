piano_bark1:

     Hey. Did you enjoy the festival? We don’t often bring guests 
     along, the Band seemed pretty happy to see a new face. 

piano_bark2:

     Don’t tell him I said this, but the Cellist has been less of a pain 
     in the ass recently. Don’t know what you did, but thanks. 

piano_bark3:

     Pipes’s been smiling a lot more. It’s nice.

piano_bark4:
     Ugh. Why did I agree to help out at the Mewseum, these paws are made 
     for carnage, not data entry.

piano_bark5:
     You know, the Boss likes you. She only brings out the snickerdoodles 
     for special guests.

piano_bark6:
     Make sure you visit, yeah? Gonna miss you. 

singer_bark1:
     >You find the Singer hard at work on that bootleg plant cloning
     program you helped them with. They've been having quite a lot of 
     success, and they're quite proud of their latest bunch of Mr. 
     Stripeys. They weren't kidding when they said tomato names got weird.

singer_bark2:
     > You get a wave when you head over, and the Singer thanks you for 
     helping the Pianist. She’s been smiling a lot more lately, it’s nice.

singer_bark3:
     > You find the Singer sitting with the Cellist. They both appear 
     to be...meditating? You sit with them both a while.

singer_bark4:
     > The Singer smiles, but seems a little sad. They confess that 
     they’re going to miss you very much when you leave.

singer_bark5:
     > The Singer brightens when you approach! You spend a while reading 
     their report on the progress of the Mewseum's residents. 

singer_bark6:
     > The Singer is sat watching the Bartender with starry eyes, as 
     the other cat plays them a sweet tune on her trumpet. You leave them
     to it. 

cello_bark1:
     you know for how much people talk up pufferfish toxin i think they're
     just cowards. i love to take bites out of them like apples and look 
     at me, i'm the picture of health

cello_bark2:
     i really need to talk to pipes one of these days about getting more 
     proper literature in the library. a man can only read so many prima 
     strategy guides before he longs for some good ol' william burroughs 
     y'know

cello_bark3:
     one of these days i'm going to find out where the Bartender locked
     up all the absinthe. i don't even particularly want to drink it, 
     it doesn't even make you hallucinate a little bit, but it's a matter
     of pride at this point

cello_bark4:
     you seen the Pianist lately? i realize i've been kind of a bastard
     lately and i've been meaning to apologize but i think she's still mad
     about the time i tried to set up a cane toad breeding program. little
     bastards didn't even give a high worth the heart attack

cello_bark5:
     people keep bitching about the fact that they don't have flying cars
     yet. i'm over here wondering why in the hell we don't have robots 
     that recite "there will come soft rains" as they do your household 
     chores just to fuck with you
     
cello_bark6:
     sometimes i wonder about that one old poet who wondered if he was a
     butterfly dreaming about being a man or a man dreaming about being
     a butterfly, and if i'm in that kind of situation man i want to know
     what kind of butterfly got fucked in the head enough to think of me


bar_truebark1:
     Ah, always a pleasure to see you, <playername>. 
     The Bar Samsara isn’t the same without you.

bar_truebark2:
     The Pianist and the Cellist have been getting along better than 
     I ever dreamed, as of late. Thank you again for the role you 
     played in their reconciliation. 

bar_truebark3:
     The Singer was telling me that you helped fix Emily Bronto. 
     That was very kind. The world needs more people like you, 
     *player*.

bar_truebark4:
     I’ve been thinking of putting Ambrosia back on the menu one day, 
     if the Cellist keeps up this streak of responsible consumption. 
     Perhaps in fifty years or so.

bar_truebark5:
     I must say, I’ll miss you dearly when your path takes you away from 
     us. Should you visit, there will always be a seat for you at the 
     Bar Samsara.

bar_truebark6:
     I saw the Pianist smile while helping at the Mewseum earlier. I 
     nearly dropped a bottle in shock.

piano_truebark1:

     Good to see you. How’s life as a freelancer treating ya? 

piano_truebark2:

     Between you and me, I think this ‘going legit’ thing won’t last too  
     long. Give it a hundred years, and you’ll probably see us out on the
     Voidway again. 

piano_truebark3:

     Hey, uh, have you seen the Singer? I got the guest beds set up in 
     the old study wing of the Mewseum like they asked. 

piano_truebark4:

     Don’t tell him I said this, but it’s been nice hanging out with the 
     Cellist recently. Thanks for helping him out. It’s good to have my 
     friend back. 

piano_truebark5:

     I managed another improvisation yesterday. I thought it was pretty 
     shit, but the Bartender loved it. It’s a start, right?

piano_truebark6:

     What, hoping for some grand emotional gesture? Pfffft. C’mon. I will
     miss you when you leave, though.

singer_truebark1:
     > The Singer is sat with the Bartender, playing Go. They both greet 
     you fondly and you spend a while watching them play.

singer_truebark2:
     > The Singer gives you a hug. You sit together and they tell you 
     about the help the Pianist and Cellist have been giving them at the
     Mewseum. They're very proud of both of them.

singer_truebark3:
     > The Singer looks sad. They’ve been trying not to think about the 
     fact you’ll be leaving soon. But they thank you earnestly for the 
     happiness you’ve gifted them during your stay.

singer_truebark4:
     > You see the Singer in the middle of a lesson plan in the Mewseum,
     reading to a gaggle of Combine soldiers. You smile at how hard they
     have to choke back tears of joy when one raises a hand to ask
     them a question.

singer_truebark5:
     > The Singer waves! They show you the blueprints for a Mewseum 
     expansion. Apparently the Bar Samsara will also be expanding into 
     a hotel soon.

singer_truebark6:
     > The Singer is taking a nap with Emily Bronto, who looks downright 
     fearsome with her new battle scars.

cello_truebark1:

     welcome back my friends to the show that never ends 
     we’re so glad you could attend 
     and so on and so forth. 
     naw for real though it’s always good to see you

cello_truebark2:

     listen i’m still not used to expressing most of my emotions without 
     fifteen different layers of irony and/or hallucinogens in the way, 
     but...thanks for not giving up on me when i lost my grip. i don’t 
     think i’ll ever figure out the words that say what that meant to me.

cello_truebark3:

     it’s been so long since the Pianist smiled this much that i forgot 
     how nice one looked on her. you did good by her, kid.

cello_truebark4:

     hey. between you and me? thanks for being such a good friend to 
     pipes. they’ve always had issues making friends that weren’t robots 
     cause they’re wired a little different than most but you made them 
     feel as comfortable as we do. that ain’t common.

cello_truebark5:

     the Bartender’s holding me to that promise I made about cutting back
     and let me tell you it’s an odd hour that goes by when i don’t want 
     to go back in time and punch myself for agreeing to that. i’m 
     noticing improvements in my health, though. begrudgingly.

cello_truebark6:

     can I ask you a favor? if you see a metrocop with a little cat 
     emblem pin out there in the Void, tell them the Cellist says 
     hello...and that he’s sorry.

	&a1

a1:
	> They thank you again for the help with the pots earlier and inform you
	that the early experiments are promising.
	&a1b

a1b:
	> Thanks to some vigorous application of fertilizer they, borrowed,
	from The Cellist's supplies, the first shoots have already appeared!
	&a2

a2:
	> They also apologize for your having to witness the tiff between the
	Pianist and The Cellist. The squabbles have been less frequent since you
	arrived, and involved less wanton destruction, but they
	know how sound can carry through the bar.
	&a3

a3:
	> The Singer stares over the water, then shakes their head and passes
	you your mission briefing\:
	&a3b

a3b:
	> "This time I'm not going to ask anything too weird of you, I promise!!
	Really this one is pretty pedestrian. I need you to
	find an instance of Alyx."
	&a4

a4:
	> They further elaborate that while there's a fairly robust collection of
	entities in the Mewseum, they found a reference to an NPC named Alyx
	that appears to be relatively uncommon and thus needs to be preserved
	in a hurry. You'll be paid a premium for tracking one down. *start 4*
	&exit


idle:
	> The Singer doesn't stir when you approach, but their tablet has been
	left in reach for you.
	&idle2

idle2:
	> A short message informs you that they're more tired than normal
	because of all the excitement around the bar, and that they
	hope you don't find their frequent naps rude.
	&idle3

idle3:
	> They inform you that you should feel free to wake
	them once you've found an Alyx.
	&i1

i1:
	> There's a nice picture of them giving a big smile and holding up a
	board with "You can do it!!!!" scribbled on it attached
	to the end of the message.
	&exit

turnin:
	> You're a little unsure how to best wake The Singer, so you settle for
	hunkering down and lightly poking their paw.
	&turnin1

turnin1:
	> When this doesn't pay dividends, you have no choice.
	&turnin2

turnin2:
	> You poke the beans.
	&t1

t1:
	> The Singer grabs their tablet, flustered, and quickly writes out a
	message to the effect of if you ever wake them up like that again they
	will not be held responsible for the sick new facial scar
	you'll be sporting.
	&t2

t2:
	> They thank you for your work and their tablet dings.
	&t2b

t2b:
	> This is apparently the signal that the Alyx arrived at the Mewseum
	intact, and $25,000 is transferred to your account
	for your efforts! *finish 4*
	&t3

t3:
	> They encourage you to just call their name the next
	time you need to wake them up.

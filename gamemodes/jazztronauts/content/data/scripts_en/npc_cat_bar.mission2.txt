	Tell me, *player*, have you ever had a Cosmic Squeeze? 
	It's a favourite cocktail of mine.

	Unfortunately, preparing it requires a substantial amount of fresh 
	watermelon juice, and at this juncture fresh produce is in short 
	supply. Luckily, this dimensional juncture appears to be quite fond 
	of the fruit, as there's a downright odd amount here.
	&a2

a2:
	If you could obtain ten or so, I could potentially add the Cosmic
	Squeeze to the menu for the day. I can guarantee you cash for 
	your efforts, as well. *start 2*

	Hm. No need to restock the sugar cider yet, we have an ample supply

	Oh! I didn't hear you approach, *player*. 
	&a5

a5:
	Just doing a stock check. It'll take me a while, so there's no need
	to fret about the watermelons yet. I need to fill out an order form
	for chilled starlight, and that will be a whole separate ordeal.

	and sets it on the bar. With a flick of her paw, it becomes encased
	in a pulsing, pink sphere. Her face furrows in intense concentration,
	and you hear something uncannily like a Wilhelm scream from within.

	> After a few seconds, she slides a glass full of a glimmering silver
	liquid under the sphere, which dissipates. Two tiny balls of 
	watermelon fall into the glass, and you hear a muffled explosion 
	as they sink through the silver fluid.

	transmutation. You can't quite get a grasp on what color the liquid 
	inside is, now. Hesitantly, you take a sip.

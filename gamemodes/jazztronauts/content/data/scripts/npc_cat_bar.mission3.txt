     Oh thank f- *player*, I’m afraid I desperately need your help. 
     All of our propane has gone missing. And by gone missing, I mean I 
     found the Cellist floating face down in the contemplation pond 
     surrounded by empty tanks.

     He’s alive, don’t worry. I am unsure exactly how, but he appears 
     to be in whatever counts for him as purrfect health.
     &a2

a2:
     Regardless, he’s left me in a bit of a pickle. Our stovetop is gas 
     operated, you see. Inelegant, I know, but until we can get our hands
     something more advanced we must make do.

     Given the need for some urgency, this will be your best paid job 
     from me yet. Fifteen tanks should be sufficient to build a 
     buffer against any further experimentation by our mutual friend. *start 3*

     So sorry, I don’t have time to chat right now. I’m doing my best to
     keep snacks available, but I had to construct a bread oven in the
     back room to do so and it is rather difficult to get an even bake.

     Oh dear, I think I smell something burning. I have to go.

     Thank you! Thank you. If I had to make another baked alaska in a 
     wood powered bread oven I was going to cry.

     I cannot overstate how important your efforts have been both to me 
     and the Bar Samsara itself.*end 3*

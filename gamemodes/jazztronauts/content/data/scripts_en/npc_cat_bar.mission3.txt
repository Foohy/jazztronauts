	Oh thank f- *player*, I'm afraid I desperately need your help. 
	All of our propane has gone missing. And by gone missing, I mean I 
	found the Cellist floating face down in the contemplation pond 
	surrounded by empty tanks.

	He's alive, don't worry. I am unsure exactly how, but he appears 
	to be in whatever counts for him as purrfect health.
	&a2

a2:
	Regardless, he's left me in a bit of a pickle. Our stovetop is gas 
	operated, you see. Inelegant, I know, but until we can get our hands
	on something more advanced we must make do.
	&a3

a3:
	Given the need for some urgency, this will be your best-paid job 
	from me yet. Fifteen tanks should be sufficient to build a 
	buffer against any further experimentation by our mutual friend. *start 3*

	So sorry, I don't have time to chat right now. I'm doing my best to
	keep snacks available, but I had to construct a bread oven in the
	back room to do so and it is rather difficult to get an even bake.

a4:
	Oh dear, I think I smell something burning. I have to go.

	Thank you! Thank you. If I had to make another Baked Alaska in a

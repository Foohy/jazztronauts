### BOMB ASS STICKY BUNS
### A note from Jared, the writer of this branch: 
###
### With being kind to other people and helping friends through rough times being such a fundamental
### part of the story and writing of Jazztronauts, I feel compelled to memorialize the woman who
### quietly taught me how to do that by example. 
###
### The recipe in this conversation branch was contributed in memory of my grandmother, 
### who passed away not long after development of Jazztronauts began. She made this 
### recipe for her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren probably hundreds
### of times between all the holidays, birthdays, and reunions. She kept the recipe secret
### for decades, despite the simplicity, because she enjoyed the mystique (and leverage at holidays).
### She eventually relented and revealed her many secret recipes, but this was the one we all wanted. 
### (Well, that or the snack mix.)
###
### I cannot express through words how much she meant to all of us. 
### She was the kindest person I have ever known.
###
### If you've read this far and not rolled your eyes, thanks. I hope you like these sticky buns
### even half as much as my family does, but I won't give you shit if you don't. They ain't high
### cuisine, like the Bortles say.

	there is a terracotta pot on the table.

	*setspeaker npc_cat_bar*
	-So if I understand correctly, your research suggests we may now be 
	able to clone plants if we grow the original to maturity in these?

	> The Singer nods so fast their head is nearly a blur.
	They seem to be putting in a conscious effort to 
	restrain their bounces.

	*setspeaker npc_cat_bar*
	Incredible work. Having ready access to fresh ingredients would do 
	wonders for our budget, and of course 
	the quality of our menu. I- Oh!
	&a4
	
a4:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_bar*
	Forgive us, we were so engrossed in our conversation that we didn't 
	notice you there. Your timing is impeccable.

a5:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_sing*
	> The Singer continues nodding. At this rate, they're going to get a 
	hell of a headache. The Bartender appears to have the same thought, 
	and touches a paw to their shoulder.
	&a6
	
a6:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_sing*
	> The Singer stops nodding and instead beams at you. They write up 
	your mission brief and slide the tablet across the table\:
	&a7
	
a7:
	> "Hi excellent yes you're here!!! As you probably overheard, I've 
	made some incredible strides in my research at the Mewseum!!!!! 
	&a7b
	
a7b:
	But to put it into practice I'm going to need your help again,

	> The Singer is clearly very busy, but they still smile and 
	wave when you approach.
	&idle2
	
idle2:
	> While they are very excited to try turning theory into reality, 
	they don't want you to overwork yourself and encourage taking 
	regular breaks. And also visiting the Bartender for snacks.
	&exit

turnin:
	> The Singer claps with glee as you present your haul of pots.
	&turnin2
	
turnin2:
	Apparently they went out on an expedition of their own to find 
	some seeds, and are very excited to try growing three different 
	varieties of tomatoes for their experiment. 
	&turnin3
	
turnin3:
	At least. They think they're tomatoes. 
	Heirloom names get weird. *finish 3*
	&t1
	
t1:
	> You learn many tomato facts over the next ten minutes. 
	Namely that there's a lot of tomatoes named after other fruits. 
	Black Cherry. Banana Legs. Green Grape.
	&t2
	
t2:
	> Eventually the Singer remembers that they actually need to 
	start planting, and hand you your pay of $20,000. 
	&t3

t3:
	> They thank you for your assistance and roll up their sleeves
	to get started on the daunting task of agriculture fraud.

	there is a terracotta pot on the table.

	-So if I understand correctly, your research suggests we may now be 
	able to clone plants if we grow the original to maturity in these?

	> The Singer nods so fast their head is nearly a blur.
	They seem to be putting in a conscious effort to 
	restrain their bounces.

	*setspeaker npc_cat_bar*
	Incredible work. Having ready access to fresh ingredients would do 
	wonders for our budget, and of course 
	the quality of our menu. I- Oh!
	&a4
	
a4:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_bar*
	Forgive us, we were so engrossed in our conversation that we didn't 
	notice you there. Your timing is impeccable.

a5:
	*setspeaker npc_cat_sing*
	> The Singer continues nodding. At this rate, they're going to get a 
	hell of a headache. The Bartender appears to have the same thought, 
	and touches a paw to their shoulder.
	&a6
	
a6:
	> The Singer stops nodding and instead beams at you. They write up 
	your mission brief and slide the tablet across the table\:
	&a7
	
a7:
	> "Hi excellent yes you're here!!! As you probably overheard, I've 
	made some incredible strides in my research at the Mewseum!!!!!

a7b:
	But to put it into practice I'm going to need your help again, 
	/ᐠ. ｡.ᐟ\\ We need 10 flower pots for science!!!!"

	> The Singer is clearly very busy, but they still smile and 
	wave when you approach.
	&idle2
	
idle2:
	> While they are very excited to try turning theory into reality, 
	they don't want you to overwork yourself and encourage taking 
	regular breaks. And also visiting the Bartender for snacks.

turnin:
	> The Singer claps with glee as you present your haul of pots.
	&turnin2
	
turnin2:
	> Apparently they went out on an expedition of their own to find 
	some seeds, and are very excited to try growing three different 
	varieties of tomatoes for their experiment. 
	&turnin3
	
turnin3:
	> At least. They think they're tomatoes. 
	Heirloom names get weird. *finish 3*
	&t1
	
t1:
	> You learn many tomato facts over the next ten minutes. 
	Namely that there's a lot of tomatoes named after other fruits. 
	Black Cherry. Banana Legs. Green Grape.
	&t2
	
t2:
	> Eventually the Singer remembers that they actually need to 
	start planting, and hand you your pay of $20,000. 
	&t3

t3:
	> They thank you for your assistance and roll up their sleeves
	to get started on the daunting task of agriculture fraud.

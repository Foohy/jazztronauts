	I didn't really consider the need for introductions when we nabbed y'all,
	but I suppose it'd be polite.

	Not feeling that at this juncture though, so let's talk about what you

	I'll be real with you for a moment. Pop a squat and I'll share some lore.
	Listen close 'cause this is primo shit.
	You ready?

	I'm fucking poor.

	People out there have too much stuff; time on their hands; 
	and no sense of aesthetics. It's shameful. 
	You're gonna redistribute that wealth to where it belongs\:
	under my fluffy ass.
	&a6
	
a6:
	I'll compensate you for your time, and we can have a 
	discussion about how to best eat the rich in a civilized 
	and polite manner when we're sitting pretty on the 
	fruits of your labor. Five ought to do. *start 0*

a7:
	And hey, if it makes you feel better about it, 
	consider yourself an antiques dealer.
	You'll be joining the ranks of a storied profession with 
	a legacy of selling other people's shit.

	> The Singer signals for you to keep your voice down as you approach.
	The Cellist is snowring loudly next to them. They pat him on the head
	and the snoring settles down into vaguely disgruntled mumbling.

a1:
	> The Singer has your next job ready, and hands the tablet over to you for
	you to check the details: "Okay so bear with me here because I know how weird
	it sounds, but I need a bunch of messed up dolls. NUMBER, to be more precise."
	&a2
	
a2:
	camera cut to player, cut back to tablet
	> You shake your head and keep reading\:
	"I'm really close to a research breakthrough!!!! I'm sure if I throw more bodies at
	the problem something will stick but last time when I asked the Pianist for help she...
	well, there were a lot of bodies but it wasn't what I. Meant. (=ʘ ༝ ʘ=)”
	&a3
	
a3:
	> The payment looks solid, NUMBER doesn't seem like a bad deal for tracking down
	fucked up dolls. *start 1*

	> The Singer waves goodbye as you hand back the tablet and leave.

	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> The Singer waves you over. Their tablet appears to be playing a recording of a 
	light rainstorm. They explain the Cellist was having a nightmare, so they're helping.
	He appears to be sleeping relatively soundly, albeit on his face in a puddle of his 
	own drool, so you guess it's working.
	&i1
	
i1:
	> They tell you not to worry about prioritizing the dolls as the research isn't time 
	sensitive, but they'd really like to try out their newest hypothesis soon and look
	forward to your successful return!

	*setspeaker narrator*
	>This feels like one of those rare times you can surprise the Cellist, so you just
	quietly open the sack of horrible haunted dolls in your hands.

t3:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> Ignoring the Cellist's babbling at the sight of your sack full of probably-not-haunted
	children's toys, the Singer takes them off your hands in exchange for the promised
	payment of NUMBER. *finish 1*
	&t4

	*setspeaker cat_cello*

	your ass so badly you won't be able to sit down without it going ooOooOOoOOo
	&t5
	
t5:
	*setspeaker cat_singer*
	> They pat him on the arm and the Cellist squints in continued suspicion at the sack, but
	stops rambling about ancient curses. The Singer thanks you for your assistance and tells
	you to find them later, if you feel like giving them a hand entering the haul into the
	Mewseum's systems.

     Ah! 100 Shards! Fantastic work, everyone! Now we can begin the 
     Festival.

     Now, this will require something of a leap of faith.

##[Cut to bar surface, glass full of shard goop]
a2:
     Drink this. Then we can call the trolley, and proceed to the 
     Festival. 

     It won’t harm you, I assure you.

            Yo hold up no, I know what that stuff does to the Cellist.

            Alright, let’s party. [Slam that shit]

     Oh good heavens, this isn't his! This is specially treated shard
     goop. It's been processed quite minimally as opposed to the, um,
     decidedly elaborate methods and ingredients he uses to turn it
     into his drug of choice.

bats2:     
     Think of it as more of a potion. This is as close as any of us will
     ever get to real magic. To reach the Festival, some preparation is 
     required.
     player:
          &slammin: Well, alright then, if you're sure. [Slam that shit]

slammin:
    *setspeaker cat_bar*
     Excellent! Bottoms up, everyone.

slammin2:
     Ah. Refreshing.

     Right, to the trolley!

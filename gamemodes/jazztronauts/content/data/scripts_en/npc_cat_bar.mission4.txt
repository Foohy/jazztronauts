	*player*, a delight to see you as always. I have a job for you, 
	if you have the time.

	I will be frank. I adore my friends, truly, but the Cellist and 
	Pianist both make such a mess. Neither empties their pockets before 
	giving me their laundry and despite my best efforts, some detritus
	always finds its way into our washing machines.

	Which are now broken, because fingerbones, bullets, conkers and 
	glass phials full of battery acid really aren't supposed to get 
	jammed in the drums, as you might imagine. 
	&a3

a3:
	So, if you could fetch me five replacement washing machines, I would
	be greatly appreciative. *start 4*

idle:
	You might want to keep your distance. I have been unable to take 
	care of the laundry for a week and I can only use our makeshift 
	mangle on one suit at a time, so I'm afraid I'm a little ripe. 
	&a4

a4:
	If you could get those machines for me soon, I'd be in your debt. 
	Running the Bar Samsara and a manual laundry at the same time is 
	quite difficult.

	I daren't consider the chaos that we'd have had to live through 
	without your help with these jobs.

	Your payment, as promised.

	If you'll kindly excuse me, I need to go put my own suits through 
	the wash and then take a much-needed nap. *finish 4*

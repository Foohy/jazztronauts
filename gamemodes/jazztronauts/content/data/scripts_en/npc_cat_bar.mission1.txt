     Ah, *player*. I am glad you dropped by, I have a job you might 
     be interested in. Every now and then we are required to scavenge for
     parts in order to keep the trolley operational.

     While I do not anticipate an imminent breakdown, our supply of 
     suspension springs and comfortable car seats is running low. 
     &a2

a2:
     Rather than send you to collect those specific parts, I feel as 
     though there's a more efficient way to handle the situation. So to 
     that end, I would deeply appreciate it if you would be able to  
     acquire ten cars.
     &a3

a3:
     I will, naturally, compensate you for your efforts. *start 1*

     *player*, lovely to see you. Care for a drink?
     &a4

a4:
     Oh, there is no need to look so concerned. As I said when you took 
     the job, the trolley is not in danger of an imminent breakdown. I am
     not going to harangue you about taking some time to ensure you are 
     properly hydrated.

     And since you are doing me a favour with this job, your first three
     drinks are on the house!

     Excellent! Let me just compress those into one of the Mewseum's 
     extradimensional storage containers for you.

     Thank you kindly for your help. We should be able to keep the 
     trolley in service for at least the next century!

     You've already proven that hiring you was an excellent decision - 
     drop by later, if you'd care to participate in a community activity 
     I organize from time to time. *finish 1*

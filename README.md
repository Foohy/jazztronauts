(pls support the devs, they're very awesome.)

# what the hell is this
basically i wanted to learn how to mess with github projects, so i chose this to poke around with.
i especially wanted to mess with the game's UI, particulary the dialog section of the game.
maybe even improve the dialog a little.

here are some examples i've whipped up.

(is concept, not in-game yet)

# why
absolutely love the game, wanted to contribute a little as thanks for allowing me
to sink hours into gmod that i would've otherwise never found (shoutout to my friend).
